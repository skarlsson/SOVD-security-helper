# ECU Security Secrets Configuration
# Each ECU type maps to an algorithm and shared secret (hex-encoded).
# In production, replace this with your OEM key management system.

# -- Authentication -------------------------------------------------------
# Uncomment and configure for OIDC JWT validation (production).
# When [auth] is absent, defaults to static mode (requires --token flag).

# [auth]
# mode = "oidc"
#
# [[auth.providers]]
# name = "google"
# issuer = "https://accounts.google.com"
# audience = "your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
# client_secret = "your-client-secret"
#
# [[auth.providers]]
# name = "entra"
# issuer = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0"
# audience = "your-application-client-id"
# client_secret = "your-client-secret"
